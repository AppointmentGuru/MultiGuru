# MultiGuru
Adds a permissions layer on top of other AppointmentGuru services

So this should proxy requests on behalf of users who have been granted permissions from practitioners

Group = practice / collection of permissions

To a group you can then assign permissions.

[ ] Administrate group
[ ] full access
[ ] see available slots
[ ] see calendar
[ ] make appointments

As a practitioner:

Create a group (e.g.: practice, referrers, )
